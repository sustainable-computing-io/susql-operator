# Using SusQL with the Green Software Foundation's Impact Framework

A large design point in using SusQL data with the Green Software Foundation's
Impact Framework is whether to run in a container ON the cluster, or run on a machine
external to the cluster.

This directory contains two directories with experiments into both approaches:

- [onClusterApproach](onClusterApproach)
- [offClusterApproach](offClusterApproach)
